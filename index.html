    <h1>position: static;</h1>
<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is 
always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>
<div class="static">
 This div element has position: static;
</div>
<h2>position: relative;</h2>
<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
<div class="relative">
This div element has position: relative;
</div>
<h3>position: fixed;</h3>
<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>
<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
</div>
<div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
<p>Try to <b>scroll</b> inside this frame to understand how sticky positioning works.</p>
<div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
